Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
a) O(n) will only iterate through n once
b) O(n^3) uses 4 for loops so three extra iterations
c)O(n) will run until bunnies are exhausted and count the ears.

II)n floors, must use floor _f_ or higher. So you could test a BST as each drop will split off into higher or lower so it will take O(log n) to run.
